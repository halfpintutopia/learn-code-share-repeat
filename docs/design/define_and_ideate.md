<h1>Define and Ideate</h1>

_How can we create a web application that combines the video-sharing aspects of a video-sharing platform (e.g. YouTube)
with the knowledge-sharing and quality control elements of a specialised Q&A platform tailored to programming and
software development question (e.g. StackOverflow) to enhance learning and collaboration for coders?_

## Problem Statement

As a coder, I often need help to retain information and face challenges when effectively applying the concepts I learn
to real coding projects. I find it difficult to transfer my knowledge to actually building an application.

### The 5Ws:

1. Who? **Identify the key stakeholders involved in the problem statement:**
    - coders,
    - content creators
    - learners
    - potential employers
2. What? **Define the problem and the key issues on existing video-sharing platforms for coding education:**
    - quality
    - relevance
    - constructive interactions
3. Where? **The online environment where this problem occurs:**
    - video-sharing platforms like YouTube
4. When? **Determine when this problem becomes noticeable:**
    - changes in coding technologies
    - educational trends
    - job market trends
5. Why? **The underlying causes and motivations behind the problem:**
    - coding tutorial videos become outdated
    - comments contains non-constructive criticism
    - copy and paste but not understanding why it works (or doesn't)

### The 5Cs:

1. Customers? **Identify the target audience for the web application.** Who are the users, and what are their specific
   needs and preferences regarding coding education and video-sharing platforms? Understanding your potential users is
   crucial for designing a solution that caters to their requirements.
2. Company? **Assess my capabilities and constraints.** What resources, expertise, and constraints do I have when
   developing this web application? This consideration is essential to ensure the solution aligns with my strengths and
   limitations.
3. Competition? **Research existing video-sharing and coding education platforms to understand what makes them
   successful or where they fall short.** Identify the strengths and weaknesses of potential competitors to inform your
   platform's unique value proposition.
4. Collaborators? **Determine if there are potential partners or collaborators in the coding education and video-sharing
   space.** Partnerships can help you access expertise, content, or resources that enhance the quality of your platform.
5. Climate? **Analyse the external factors affecting the coding education and video-sharing industry.** Are there
   emerging trends, regulatory changes, or technological developments that could impact my solution's success or
   viability?
