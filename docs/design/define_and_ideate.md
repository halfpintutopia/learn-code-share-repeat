<h1>Define and Ideate</h1>

_How can we create a web application that combines the video-sharing aspects of a video-sharing platform (e.g. YouTube)
with the knowledge-sharing and quality control elements of a specialised Q&A platform tailored to programming and
software development question (e.g. StackOverflow) to enhance learning and collaboration for coders?_

## Problem Statement
As a coder, I often need help to retain information and face challenges when effectively applying the concepts I learn
to real coding projects. I find it difficult to transfer my knowledge to actually building an application.
