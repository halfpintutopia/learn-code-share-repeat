<h1>Five PLanes of </h1>

During the initial brainstorming phases, I used this part primarily to generate ideas and concepts. However, I refined
and defined these ideas further using matrices. This iterative approach allowed me to develop more precise and
well-structured solutions as I advanced through the design or problem-solving process.
