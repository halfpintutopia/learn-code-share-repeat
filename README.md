<h1>Learn Code Share Repeat</h1> 

_I aim to address the existing limitations in online video-sharing platforms where educational content
related to programming and coding becomes outdated, irrelevant, and plagued by non-constructive comments._

_I want to develop a solution that empowers coders to share their knowledge through video content in a way that ensures
the content remains up-to-date, well-explained, and transparent and fosters constructive interactions among users._

_The goal is to create an innovative web application that serves as a tool to enhance knowledge and understanding,
taking inspiration from the Richard Feynman technique, where the quality of content is paramount, and the community of
learners and experts collaborates to enhance the learning experience._
