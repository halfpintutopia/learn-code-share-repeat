_I aim to address the existing limitations in online video-sharing platforms where educational content
related to programming and coding becomes outdated, irrelevant, and plagued by non-constructive comments. I want to
develop a solution that empowers coders to share their knowledge through video content in a way that ensures the content
remains up-to-date, well-explained, and transparent and fosters constructive interactions among users. The goal is to
create an innovative web application that serves as a tool to enhance knowledge and understanding, taking inspiration
from the Richard Feynman technique, where the quality of content is paramount, and the community of learners and experts
collaborates to enhance the learning experience._
